# Hangman
Hangman is a word guessing game which can be used to facilitate foreign language learning.
It uses Python for the server-side programming and jQuery for the client-side.
The game updates the wordlist when the number of unused words for a user reduces.
The words are taken from the wordlist in the FLAX website(http://flax.nzdl.org/greenstone3/flax).
It also maintains user accounts and high scores for a specific user and global high scores via JSON files.
