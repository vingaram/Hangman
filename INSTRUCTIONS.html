Hangman is a word guessing game where the player has to guess a word by guessing letters. If the letters are present in
the word, the appropriate positions are filled in with those letters. Otherwise, the letter is
crossed out and the elements of a hanging man are drawn. If the word is completed before
the diagram is complete, the player who is guessing wins and he loses if the hanging man is
completely drawn.

To guess a letter, you must press the letter in the keyboard or click the letter on the screen. You have 4 attempts for each word.
The top-left corner shows your user name and the scores and attempts left are shown in the centre. You can click the "BACK TO MENU" button to get back to the main screen thereby ending your current play.
The highscores page displays the highest scores overall and also your highest scores. The Global high scores shows the username and the score for top 10 positions and "Your high scores" shows your 10 highest scores.
